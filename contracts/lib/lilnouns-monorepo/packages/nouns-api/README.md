# @nouns/api

A express webserver that supports the Prop Lot feature. This app uses Prisma to manage a postgres DB. In local development you will want to copy the values in `.env.example.local` to your `.env` file and update the `DATABASE_URL` to point to your local Postgres instance.

## Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

## Start API (Development)

```sh
yarn dev
```
